# code-eval
My solutions to code-eval challenges. Currently written for Py2.x (will later port solutions to 3.x).

Each solution is stored in a folder with the problem ID as the ending element. Any solution spec can be accessed
by inserting the ID in this URL: https://www.codeeval.com/browse/ID_NUMBER_HERE/. As an example, problem 132
is [here](https://www.codeeval.com/browse/132/).

Note that solutions are written quickly and often to a minimal spec. Given how CodeEval evaluates code, code is written
to be lightweight and fast. Best practices will not always be followed here.
