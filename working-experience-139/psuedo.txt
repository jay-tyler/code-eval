1. Make datetime ranges
2. Sort list of datetime ranges by ascending start datetime
3. Use adjacent pointers to compare and combine datetime ranges; work from end of list inwards to avoid clusterfucking pointers
4. Calculate int-rounded years from list of ranges


clean_ranges steps
1. pop from ranges
2. pop again from ranges
3. attempt to combine #1 #2
5. if two ranges back, appendright #1 to cached
6. if one range back, do nothing 
7. morph identity for #2 to pointer for #1
8. pop from ranges as new #2
9. back to step #3
